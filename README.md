## 🔐 Auth Flow

1. User logs in via frontend → sends credentials to Go Auth server
2. Auth server validates and issues JWT
3. Frontend stores JWT securely and attaches it to all Apollo requests
4. Hasura uses JWT to apply RBAC permissions

---

## 🗃️ Database Schema Overview

```sql
users(id, name, email, role)
skills(id, name, category)
user_skills(id, user_id, skill_id, proficiency, years_experience)
teams(id, name, manager_id)
team_members(team_id, user_id)
certifications(id, user_id, name, url, issued_at)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Auth Server

```bash
cd backend/auth-server
go test ./...
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/nuxt-app
